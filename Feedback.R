# Feedback: CTA exercise 5 (2024)

# question 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# the code is fine - it would have made sense to change your variable name (you kept 'tocq' as if you were still working with the Tocqueville books)

# question 2
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# again the code is fine, althoygh you didn't adjust the consistency analysis (you could have e.g. compared different chapters rather than different volumes) 
# you didn't explain your choice of a number of topics, and your topics are not very convincing (they look quite similar in terms of keywords) 
# crucially, there is no interpretation of the analyses or results

# question 3
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# You correctly ran the PreText analyses but didn't interpret the outputs. Would have been worth checking the documentation for PreText
# that would have helped you make sense of the output and interpret it.

# overall code quality: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Overall you re-used the exercise code pretty well and you explained some of your codes and decisions well
# You also correctly knitted the doc (although you kept the useless example markdown plots at the beginning?)
# ideally you need to adjust the code to your particular interests, not just re-run it exactly as the example
# e.g. in this case you could have compared differnet books by Austen or different chapters

# overall interpretation: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# You didn't include any interpretation; this is a non-negotiable for the final assignment. 
# If you only run the code but do not explain what the analyses means for the text and how to interpret and learn from the results 
# and the modelling, then your assignment will be failed... 
# Make sure you focus a lot more on interpretation and analyses in your final assignment!
